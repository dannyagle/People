# People
Easily generate random people first and last names.  Useful for populating demo data with fictional people with real names.

The names comes from old census files.  I made lists of the top 1000 male names, female names, and family names and turned 
them into json files for files easy consumption.  My code currently ignores the frequency value found in the census data.
